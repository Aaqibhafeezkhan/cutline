Add shapes: rectangles (with rounded corners) and ellipses with fill and outline, as a new `shape` clip type. Agents use the new `add_shape` MCP tool (and `set_clip_property` for width, height, fill, stroke and corner radius); the editor has toolbar buttons and a Shape section in the properties panel. Shapes render in the browser (WebGL) and in the server renderer (ffmpeg), and support transforms, keyframes, fades, transitions and effects like other visual clips.
